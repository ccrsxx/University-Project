        #### Intro

        I made this web app to finish a project assigned by my teacher. 
        While that's the main purpose of why I made this. 
        The real purpose was to improve my coding skill, 
        and I learned a lot while making this web app.
        
        This web app is written purely in Python.
        It contains three games. The games are:

        1. Guess Number
        2. Guess Word
        3. Tic Tac Toe

        All of them can be accessed on the sidebar.
        As for the source code, I will share it once all is finished.
